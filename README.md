# Password-Generator

## Description
This project was made to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.
This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 
A new, secure password is generated when the button is clicked. Then you are presented series of prompts for password criteria. WHEN the password is generated it is written to the page.
The challenge helps to undestand the core skills of JavaScript: functions, loops, querySelector,addEventListener.

## Installation
This application does not require an installation, just follow the link: https://promisethecat.github.io/Password-Generator/

## Usage

To use this page, you can review the code and styles in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see elements, attributes,styles, we learned from the course session and how you can use them in the future.

The application (password generation) works in several stages:

1. By clicking on the link, a window with a red button "Generate Password" will open in front of you (image 1);
2. Click on the button and a pop-up window will appear on the screen that will ask you to enter the length of the code, a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 128 characters (image 2);
3. If you enter a length that does not match the criteria, the following window will pop up with a warning about the length of the password. For a new generation, click the "Generate Password" button again (image 3);
4. In the next step, there will be 4 pop-ups asking you if you want to add a lower case, upper case, numeric or special characters to your password (image 4);
5. If you select none of the four character types, a pop-up window will appear warning you that you must select at least one type and code generation will stop. To continue, go through all steps 1 to 4 (image 5);
6. If all the steps are completed in accordance with the requirements of the program in the window above the red button, you will receive your code(image 6).
